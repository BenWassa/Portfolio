## Core Description

- Portfolio summary: Experimental audio interfaces and sonic interaction patterns - exploring the intersection of sound and digital experience.
- Full description: Project Orpheus is a lyrical lantern into the underworld of memory and emotion. By tracing the songs you play on repeat - the fixations, the phases, the sudden crescendos - it reveals the hidden narratives shaping your life. Like Orpheus descending with music as his guide, this framework transforms passive listening into active self-discovery through structured analysis, mythic symbolism, and reflective prompts. Thoughtfully designed for slow, deliberate exploration, it lets you chart emotional currents, pivotal transitions, and unmet needs inside a poetic, soul-centered map where every refrain becomes a clue to becoming more wholly yourself.
