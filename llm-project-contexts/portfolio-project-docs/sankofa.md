- Full description: Project Sankofa is an overarching narrative framework to tackle the Modern Meaning Crisis. It weaves mythic storytelling, cultural critique, and deep research into a unified exploration of how contemporary life lost cohesive meaning - and how people might find soul, purpose, and moral compass again. Sankofa ties together dopamine work, rites of passage concepts, and narrative design into a podcast or multimedia experience that blends rigorous insight with emotionally resonant mythic arcs.
