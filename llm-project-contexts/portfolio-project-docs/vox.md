## Core Description
- Card description: Vocabulary and grammar studying tool.
- Portfolio summary: Advanced language-learning dashboard with progress tracking, analytics, and adaptive learning algorithms (in development).
- Full description: Vox is a pilot framework for building a rigorous, self-directed language learning system. It emphasizes grammar mastery, transparent vocab tracking, and real-world sentence production - eschewing gamified fluff in favor of deliberate, adaptive practice. Designed to function fully offline with clean JSON architecture, Vox visualizes progress like a growing reservoir of knowledge, where vocabulary adds volume, grammar shapes the container, and output waters the fields of fluency. It serves as both prototype and proof-of-concept for a learner-first, data-transparent alternative to mainstream apps.
