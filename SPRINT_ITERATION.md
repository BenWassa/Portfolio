Commissioned Sprint

Title: Portfolio Evolution Layer
Duration: 1–2 focused sessions (3–5 hours total)

Objective

Add a subtle but explicit layer to the portfolio that communicates the evolution of technical skill, design maturity, and human–AI collaboration across projects, without changing the existing layout or visual language.

---

Scope (Tightly Bounded)

1. Add Iteration Metadata

    Deliverable
    - Introduce an iteration field per project:

    ```
    iteration: "I" | "II" | "III" | "IV"
    ```

    Intent
    - Signal era of capability, not quality or versioning.
    - Reframe early projects as foundations, not liabilities.

---

2. Add Interface Classification (Lightweight)

    Deliverable

    ```
    interface: "narrative" | "system" | "utility"
    platform: "desktop-first" | "mobile-first" | "hybrid"
    ```

    Intent
    - Clarify design intent.
    - Support later explanation without defensive copy.

---

3. Modal Copy Enhancement

    Deliverable
    - Add a single line to the project modal:

    Template

    ```
    Iteration III
    Built during a phase focused on offline-first architecture and system clarity.

    Optional second line for later projects:

    Developed with AI as a design and reasoning partner.
    ```

    Constraint
    - Max 2 lines.
    - No technical boasting.
    - No tool name-dropping.

---

4. Global Portfolio Framing Line

    Deliverable
    - One sentence added to hero or About section:

    This portfolio documents not just projects, but the co-evolution of my thinking, tools, and technical craft over time.

---

Non-Goals (Explicitly Out of Scope)
- No timeline view
- No reordering of projects
- No visual ranking or progress bars
- No deep technical breakdowns
- No AI explanation sections

---

Success Criteria
- Reviewers can distinguish early vs late work at a glance
- Older projects read as intentional stepping stones
- AI usage reads as mature collaboration, not novelty
- Zero increase in visual clutter
