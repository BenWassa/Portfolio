Notes & next steps
- These statuses are conservative: "Present" means a file with the project name exists in `src/public/assets/projects/` — verify aspect ratio and intended use manually.
- To progress: open each project's markdown in `commissions/commission_01_projects/`, confirm or update paths, and check boxes when verified.
- I can scan additional locations (`backups/*`, `docs/assets/`, `public/assets/`) and append any other projects if you want.
