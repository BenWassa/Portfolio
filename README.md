# Portfolio — Benjamin P. Haddon

This repository contains a small collection of live projects and prototypes at the intersection of research, storytelling, and web technology. Each project explores design, interaction patterns, and narrative frameworks with a focus on clarity, craft, and meaning.

## Live site

You can view the hosted portfolio site here:

- https://benwassa.github.io/Portfolio/

The site is built as a static site inside the `docs/` folder and published via GitHub Pages.

## Projects (high level)


The portfolio highlights a handful of projects, including:

- Skywalker — A comprehensive UX playground for personal systems and compounding routines with advanced interaction patterns.
- Sankofa — An immersive mythic psychology narrative experience with podcast scaffolding in a living document environment.
- Dukkha — A comprehensive field guide for digital discipline—featuring live HTML experiences & systematic UX patterns.
- Vox — Advanced language-learning dashboard with progress tracking, analytics, and adaptive learning algorithms (in development).
- Orpheus — Experimental audio interfaces and sonic interaction patterns — exploring the intersection of sound and digital experience.
- Agoge — A narrative research project exploring traditional rites of passage and authentic initiation for the modern world.

For full project metadata and descriptions see `docs/project-descriptions.js`.


## Notes for maintainers

- The site's source files live in `docs/` (HTML, CSS, JS, and `Project_Images/`).
- Project metadata is exported from `docs/project-descriptions.js`. Image references in that file are relative to the `docs/` folder and were recently corrected to `Project_Images/<name>.png`.
- To update content, edit files under `docs/` and push to `main`; GitHub Pages will publish from `main` -> `docs/` (this repo is already configured that way).

Small, focused README intended to make it easy to run and update the static portfolio. If you'd like, I can add a development script, CI publish workflow, or a CONTRIBUTING.md next.
